# Trenchless Project

## Overview
This project is a web-based application built with **Vue 3** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to assist users in selecting trenchless methods, crossing options, and materials.

## Features
- Fetches methods dynamically from an API (`https://apidev.borely.com/v1/methods`).
- Includes a clean and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS.
- Interactive tabs to guide users through selections.
- Real-time loading indicators and dynamic data updates.

---

## Requirements
- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- An internet connection (required for API calls).

---

## Notes

  http-server
  ```
  Open the link provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
